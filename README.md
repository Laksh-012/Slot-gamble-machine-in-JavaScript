This project involves creating a slot machine game using only JavaScript. The game includes spinning reels that display random values (symbols) selected from a predefined set. Players can spin the reels, place bets, and check for winning combinations based on these randomly selected values. The game logic in JavaScript handles the random selection of symbols, tracking the player's balance, and determining wins or losses. This project focuses on JavaScript concepts such as array manipulation, event handling, and dynamic value selection, offering a hands-on approach to creating an interactive game without external libraries or frameworks.
