This project involves creating a slot machine game using both JavaScript and C++. In JavaScript, the game features spinning reels that display random values selected from a predefined array of symbols. Players can spin the reels, and the game determines wins or losses by comparing the results to possible winning combinations. JavaScript handles the game logic, random value selection, and updating the game state, leveraging array manipulation and event handling.

In C++, the slot machine logic is similarly structured, using arrays or vectors to store predefined symbols. Random values are selected to simulate the spinning reels, and the game checks for winning combinations based on these values. C++ is responsible for managing the random selection, tracking the playerâ€™s balance, and processing wins or losses. The project highlights key concepts in both languages, such as random value generation, array manipulation, and control structures.
